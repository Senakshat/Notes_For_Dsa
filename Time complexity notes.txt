 int count = 0;
        for (int i = N; i > 0; i /= 2) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                count += 1;
            }
        }
why is this o(N)
first loop:->LoG(N) n+n/2+n/4+... iterations:->Log base 2 N
Second Loop:-> iterations: count->N+N/2+N/4...0
the loop shrinks into total operations done in this fassion:
in A geometric operation:-

N+N/2+N/4...1
therefore 2N as 1+1/2+1/4... =2
